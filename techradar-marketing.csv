VMware Horizon,Applications,Manage,TRUE,"<p>The continued adoption of containers for deployments, especially <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker"">Docker</a>, has made <strong>container security scanning</strong> a must-have technique and we've moved this technique into Adopt to reflect that. Specifically, containers introduced a new path for security issues; it's vital that you use tools to scan and check containers during deployment. We prefer using automated scanning tools that run as part of the deployment pipeline.</p>"
